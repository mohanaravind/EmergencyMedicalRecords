	<!-- HTTP Sessions are disabled by default. To enable HTTP sessions specify: 
		<sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled> It's possible to reduce request 
		latency by configuring your application to asynchronously write HTTP session 
		data to the datastore: <async-session-persistence enabled="true" /> With 
		this feature enabled, there is a very small chance your app will see stale 
		session data. For details, see http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html#Enabling_Sessions -->
